It\\u2019s something with which the industry is very familiar, and the years of sexual misconduct that the two women uncovered is horrifying. It was one of the most important articles to ever run in the newspaper, but this story would be better suited to the page and not the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film follows writers Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) and Jodi Kantor (Zoe Kazan) as they investigate the Miramax movie mogul, trying repeatedly to get big name actresses to go on the record to expose Weinstein\\u2019s gross abuse of power. Instead of offering new insight, director Maria Schrader uses the same old newsroom clich\\u00e9s to create a pedestrian investigative journalism film. It\\u2019s procedural, boring, and repetitive, with a series of scenes featuring the two leads making phone calls, writing or reading text messages, and sitting in editorial meetings. Of course, this is less than interesting because the story isn\\u2019t cinematic: it\\u2019s dull.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film touches on the more interesting aspects of working as a woman in Hollywood, as many of Weinstein\\u2019s victims refused to be named on the record because they were terrified they\\u2019d never work again. This did happen more often than not, and he either bought or forced their silence. Perhaps if screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz had decided to focus more on the personal dilemmas and fallout his victims faced rather than only briefly touch on them, this would have been a stronger and more powerful movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven worse, the film doesn\\u2019t feel timely. The decision to tell this story now seems dated and past its expiration date. Women will always remember the #MeToo movement and it will go down in history as one of the most important feminist campaigns of the 2000s, but many of us would rather forget about Weinstein while he rots away in jail.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\\u2019s where my biggest problem with the film comes in: the story leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, especially when you stop to realize that many of Weinstein\\u2019s employees, friends, and peers either aided in covering up his crimes or even worse, willfully looked the other way. Harvey\\u2019s touchy nature and treatment of subordinates was the worst kept secret in Hollywood circles. He was as creep, and many who met him were uncomfortable being in his presence. It feels a bit disingenuous (or perhaps just a bit ironic) to make a movie about it, even if the story\\u2019s focus is on the two reporters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe better parts of the narrative inspire with the proof of the power of journalism to encourage change, and Kantor and Twohey absolutely played a huge part in giving women who were victimized the courage to come forward. Mulligan gives a strong performance, but it\\u2019s a shame she didn\\u2019t have an equally robust script to work with. Both of the leads feel wasted, especially when they are called on to do little more than rattle off facts and name-drop big actresses who came forward to expose the year of abusive behavior by Weinstein.

[\n          \"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com** Important subject matter doesn\\u2019t always translate to a good movie, and \\u201cShe Said\\u201d is a botched attempt at retelling the true story of two New York Times reporters who took down the infamous Hollywood abuser, Harvey Weinstein. It\\u2019s something with which the industry is very familiar, and the years of sexual misconduct that the two women uncovered is horrifying. It was one of the most important articles to ever run in the newspaper, but this story would be better suited to the page and not the screen. The film follows writers Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) and Jodi Kantor (Zoe Kazan) as they investigate the Miramax movie mogul, trying repeatedly to get big name actresses to go on the record to expose Weinstein\\u2019s gross abuse of power. Instead of offering new insight, director Maria Schrader uses the same old newsroom clich\\u00e9s to create a pedestrian investigative journalism film. It\\u2019s procedural, boring, and repetitive, with a series of scenes featuring the two leads making phone calls, writing or reading text messages, and sitting in editorial meetings. Of course, this is less than interesting because the story isn\\u2019t cinematic: it\\u2019s dull. The film touches on the more interesting aspects of working as a woman in Hollywood, as many of Weinstein\\u2019s victims refused to be named on the record because they were terrified they\\u2019d never work again. This did happen more often than not, and he either bought or forced their silence. Perhaps if screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz had decided to focus more on the personal dilemmas and fallout his victims faced rather than only briefly touch on them, this would have been a stronger and more powerful movie. Even worse, the film doesn\\u2019t feel timely. The decision to tell this story now seems dated and past its expiration date. Women will always remember the #MeToo movement and it will go down in history as one of the most important feminist campaigns of the 2000s, but many of us would rather forget about Weinstein while he rots away in jail. Here\\u2019s where my biggest problem with the film comes in: the story leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, especially when you stop to realize that many of Weinstein\\u2019s employees, friends, and peers either aided in covering up his crimes or even worse, willfully looked the other way. Harvey\\u2019s touchy nature and treatment of subordinates was the worst kept secret in Hollywood circles. He was as creep, and many who met him were uncomfortable being in his presence. It feels a bit disingenuous (or perhaps just a bit ironic) to make a movie about it, even if the story\\u2019s focus is on the two reporters. The better parts of the narrative inspire with the proof of the power of journalism to encourage change, and Kantor and Twohey absolutely played a huge part in giving women who were victimized the courage to come forward. Mulligan gives a strong performance, but it\\u2019s a shame she didn\\u2019t have an equally robust script to work with. Both of the leads feel wasted, especially when they are called on to do little more than rattle off facts and name-drop big actresses who came forward to expose the year of abusive behavior by Weinstein. None of this is a substitute for compelling drama, and \\u201cShe Said\\u201d fades into the void of forgettable procedural journalism films.\",\n          \"I re-watched the original _Fantastic Beasts_ today to prep for _Crimes of Grindelwald_ and it made me realise that the only reason I gave that first film a positive review was because of Queenie Goldstein. She's just **such** a sweetheart. Her character wasn't the **only** thing I liked about that movie, but without her, it still gets pushed down into Rotten. So when they took her in this one and first made her a rapist and then a Nazis, I was uh... Not exactly stoked. But that's a personal thing, and I try to, at least partially, put that aside and review on things like technical aspect. And in that Avenue, _Crimes of Grindelwald_ is an **abysmal** failure. This is not the outright worst film of the year, but it was definitely the worst one I've seen in cinemas for a long damn time. _Final rating:\\u2605\\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing.

It\\'s like it was written in committee where everyone that there little plot be added to the film despite how difficult that would make actual story telling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results are so many tiny little subplots that you end up not even caring about the main plot as they try to cram them all into the same hole. You end up just not caring at all about any of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the characters shoved into the movie to accommodate the extra plot lines are just as thin and under-developed that it\\'s really hard to care about what happens to them as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end there is so much going on that it never really focuses enough on anything to keep the audience emotionally invested and really you end up only caring about Jamie because she won you over in the first two good films and that kind of holds you just enough to actually finish a film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she weren\\'t cast in it, even her character would be hard to relate to in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes you want to take the director by the collar and yell \"focus!\" with the hopes that it would drop all the unnecessary story lines and just deal with what matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, you know, there are the political signaling, and for a lot of people that matters more than story telling.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor everyone else, there is about 15 minutes, maybe, of actual focused plot and the rest is all tangential.'], shape=(1,), dtype=string)\n",

The kid (Justin Timberlake) takes all his money and play some poker, hoping that he will win and his future secure. Well, you guessed it, he loses everything. But, not because he is bad or anything, no, there is this guy called Ivan (Ben Affleck) who runs these online casinos, and who cheats the poor young kids.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there is only one sensible thing to do, which is to go to Costa Rica and confront the bad guy with his scheme. Thats exactly what I would do. Well, nah, not really, but I hope you see where I am going with this. He arrives in Costa Rica, and soon finds himself at the deep end of the pool, hunted by Ivan, some dude named Herrera and the FBI... of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot is idiotic, as you might have guessed. It makes no sense, and the poor actors don't know how to act. And honestly, I don't blame them, they don't understand the manuscript either. I looked for a little light in the darkness, and I think I found it... the  photography. There are some beautiful images in this movie, worthy of a James Bond movie, and you know what, the plot matches the Bond movies of late pretty well too. Yeah, I am not a big Bond fan either.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Last words... it's not worth it. Ben Affleck is an overrated actor, not worth your time. Mr. Timberlake should just have stopped after The Social Network, and he would have stopped on top. This movie... don't waste your time on it.
